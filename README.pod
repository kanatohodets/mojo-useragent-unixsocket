=head1 NAME

Mojo::UserAgent::UnixSocket - User Agent connections over UNIX sockets.

=head1 VERSION

0.021

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::UserAgent::UnixSocket;

  my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent::UnixSocket->new;
  say $ua->get('unix:///var/run/docker.sock/images/json?all=true')->res->body;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::UserAgent::UnixSocket> transparently enables L<Mojo::UserAgent> to interact with services listening on Unix domain sockets.

Any invocation that works with L<Mojo::UserAgent> should also work here.

It expects URLs in the following format (the .sock is required, pending a clever patch):

  unix://<path-to-socket>.sock/<url-path>

For example, talking to the L<Docker|http:www.//docker.io/> daemon, whose socket is (typically) located at C</var/run/docker.sock>:

  unix:///var/run/docker.sock/images/nginx/json
